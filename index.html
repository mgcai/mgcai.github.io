<h1>Hello World: my name is Michael Cai</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>Web design is my passion as you can see here.</p>
<p>Here are some of my projects:</p>
<p>Tartan Jump: a doodle jump esk platforming game which features sockets and
  is built in python. Built as a term project for 15-112, combat features still
  a work in progress. Current implementation involves some buggy hitboxes and
  messy knockback values. </p>
<p>View the code here: https://github.com/mgcai/15112-Term-Project </p>
<p>HealthBlock: a blockchain technology built to securely send patient
    information between doctors and specialists. Built in Python using OOP and
    flask. Originally built at HackCMU by a team of three, the code is
    currently being updated and revamped to implement a better UI.</p>
